    <h1>Trisecting Arbitrary Angles</h1>
    
    <b>
      lol, I messed with some obtuse angles, and the method falls apart spectacularly.<br>
      I couldn't see it when I was still fiddling with acute angles.<br>
      as I expected, the idea was deeply flawed :)
    </b>
    
    <p>
      <i>
        I don't use a rule and compass often, and it turns out what looked like a
        ridged tightener on the top of the compass I bought was fake, much to my
        annoyance. Please forgive minor drafting errors. I am trying to demonstrate
        the technique, rather than my ability at it.
      </i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I was watching a video<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> earlier today, that mentioned that not only was
      it unknown how to trisect an arbitrary angle with only a rule and compass,
      but that it was proven impossible in the mid-1800s.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I thought this odd, as the same video demonstrated a technique that, so
      far as I can tell, should be able to trisect an arbitrary angle with ease.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This requires no measurements, and only the use of a straight edge and compass.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Let us create an arbitrary angle to trisect.<br>
      First an initial point.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-01.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-01s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      And then two more points of varying distances from the original.<br>
      <i>Please forgive the blurriness of a few of these images.</i>
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-03.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-02s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      Okay, now that we have our two lines, we set our compass to an arbitrary angle, and
      walk each of the lines from the initial point, putting three marks on each.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href=images/step-03.jpg>
        Here is a link to the image for just that step, but it's the blurriest of them all.
      </a><br>
      Rather just see the marks in the next step.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Next we draw a line between the third points of the two lines.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-04.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-04s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      Now we need to create some parallel lines. To do this we set another
      arbitrary angle on our compass, marking the original point, and the
      first and second points on the top line.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-05.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-05s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      Now we use our compass to take the distance of between the points where the 
      circle segment by the original angle crosses. We use this setting to mark
      the segments we drew after the first and second points to create the same
      angle at each of them.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-06.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-06s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      Now we draw parallel lines from the first and second point using these.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-07.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-07.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      Now we can draw lines from the origin through the points where the parallel
      lines cross our line between the equidistance third points on the lines.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-08.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-08s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      The angle should now be trisected.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>We create a line three times an arbitrary width on each original side.</li>
        <li>This creates an isosceles triangle, with known thirds on a side.</li>
        <li>
          We then transfer these thirds to the unknown side via the parallel lines of the well known line trisection technique.
          <sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li>Since we now know where points a third into that line are, we can draw lines from the original point through them.</li>
        <li>This divides the original angle into three equal angles.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now let's build three congruent circles across the line
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We'll start by finding the midpoints between the two four points on the end line.<br>
      First we use arcs to find points on the lines.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-09.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-09s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      And then we can draw in the lines to find the midpoints on the end-line.<br>
      <i>a little blurry again</i>
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-10.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-10s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      Now I draw a circle from the middle point, to show the other two points are equidistant from it.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-11.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-11s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      Now I set the compass to the radius from one side to the first dot, and use it to draw three congruent circles that kiss at their edges.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      They are admittedly imperfect, but this should be due moreso to the wobble of my hand than the method of their construction.
    </p>
    
    <a href=images/step-12.jpg>
      <img class=i src=images/step-12s.jpg>
    </a>
    
    <p>
      I look forward to finding out why this won't work :)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It looks to me like it should, though. It appears it could be extended to arbitrarily dividing the original angle
      since you can use an arbitrary number of points and therefore parallel lines in the construction.
